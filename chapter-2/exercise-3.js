/* Exercise 3 from chapter 2 - Chessboard

  Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

  Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
  When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
